I am now a research assistant at ShanghaiTech University with a keen interest in computational neuroscience, particularly at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University in 2024 and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Jilin University in 2018. From 2018 to 2020, I worked as an algorithm engineer, developing natural language processing (NLP) and speech algorithms.
